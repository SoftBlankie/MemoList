# MemoList
Lightweight note-taking app written in Java
Android Studio

### Goal

The goal of this app is to create a memo-taking app emphasizing on the lightweight and simplistic features for streamlining short notes.

### Features

The application is developed using Java and Android Studio. Since most android applications are written in Java, MemoList conforms to the standard conditions. While working on this development, I found that there are three different types of development that could exist, Native, Flutter, or React Native. Comparing the differences between the three, the project underwent development using Native implementation which provided the most learning experience.

Application Features:
 - CRUD priority memos
 - Categorization
 - Sorting
 - Text settings
 - Multiple theme colors
 
### Inspiration

The inspiration for this app originated from looking at a variety of memo-taking apps online and seeing that many of the apps have too much focus on the amount of features that can go into a memo list. Personally, I believed that memo-taking should be a quick and easy process in which the goal is to have the user spend as little time as they can on the app.

### Development & Process

The app was created from the ground-up with little knowledge on app development. From numerous amounts of research in app development from high-level to low-level design, Android Studio was downloaded and the process of development was underway. Although development underwent quick progression over the initial week, it was quickly found how difficult it was to manage the state of the project. Knowing little at the time, the project continued on despite such practices and finished production after all core features were developed.

The process involved following the prototyping methodology in which the customer was myself and beta-testers whom I enlisted for their feedback. A feature would be created and given feedback and continuously refined until satisfaction was reached at the end of its development.

### Challenges

Since I was still new to app development, the majority of difficulties involved getting over the initial learning curve. Then after, main difficulties involved knowing how to organize the structure of the code and design decisions that appeals to user immersion.

Major technical challenges are listed below:
- Limited app development knowledge
- Limited software development knowledge at the time
- Unorganized code hierarchy
- Difficulty finding beta-testers to receive feedback
- Slow hardware to run android studio

Major design challenges are listed below:
- Design that encourages fast notes
	- Eliminates need for long notes
- Note-taking user experience
- Overarching user experience from app initialization
- Positioning of categorization and priority labeling
- Development of the variety of app color schemes

### Further Improvements

Further improvements to this app would require an overhaul in refactoring the source code to be scalable. As it is, the code architecture would benefit from applied software design patterns and principles. With that added, allows for easier additional features and organization.
